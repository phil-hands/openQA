You can alter the appearance of the openQA web UI to some extent through
the 'branding' mechanism. The 'branding' configuration setting in the
'global' section of `/etc/openqa/openqa.ini` specifies the branding to
use. It defaults to 'openSUSE', and openQA also includes the 'plain'
branding, which is - as its name suggests - plain and generic.

To create your own branding for openQA, you can create a subdirectory
of `/usr/share/openqa/templates/branding` (or wherever openQA is
installed). The subdirectory's name will be the name of your branding.
You can copy the files from `branding/openSUSE` or `branding/plain` to
use as starting points, and adjust as necessary.

openQA uses the {mojo-website} framework's templating
system; the branding files are included into the openQA templates at
various points. To see where each branding file is actually included,
you can search through the files in the `templates` tree for the text
`include_branding`. Anywhere that helper is called, the branding file
with the matching name is being included.

The branding files themselves are Mojolicious 'Embedded Perl' templates just
like the main template files. You can read the {mojo-docs} for help with the
format.
