=head1 NAME

OpenQA::WebAPI::Controller::API::V1::Worker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenQA::WebAPI::Controller::API::V1::Worker;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements API methods relating to OpenQA Workers.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item list()

Returns a list of workers with useful information for each including its ID, the host
where the worker is located, the worker instance, the worker status and the worker's
websocket status.

=item _register()

Register a worker instance on the database or update its information if it
was already registered.

B<TODO>: this function exists purely for unit tests to be able to register
workers without fixtures so usage elsewhere should be avoided

B<NOTE>: currently this function is used in create (API entry point)

=item show()

Prints information from a worker given its ID. Each entry contains the "hostname"
and the field "status" which can be "dead", "idle", "running" and "broken".
A worker can be considered online when the status is not "dead". Broken means that
the worker is able to connect but there is some setup problem on the worker host
preventing it from taking jobs.
