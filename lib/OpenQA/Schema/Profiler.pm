=head1 NAME

OpenQA::Schema::Profiler - Logs timing information for OpenQA::Schema SQL queries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenQA::Schema::Profiler;

  OpenQA::Schema::Profiler->enable_sql_debugging;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<OpenQA::Schema::Profiler> collects statistics from L<OpenQA::Schema> about SQL
queries that have been executed. It is usually activated with the
C<OPENQA_SQL_DEBUG> environment variable. This is quite expensive and should
therefore only be used during development.
