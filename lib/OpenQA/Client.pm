=head1 NAME

OpenQA::Client - special version of Mojo::UserAgent that handles authentication

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenQA::Client;

  # create new UserAgent that is meant to talk to localhost. Reads key
  # and secret from config section [localhost]
  my $ua = OpenQA::Client->new(api => 'localhost');

  # specify key and secret manually
  my $ua = OpenQA::Client->new(apikey => 'foo', apisecret => 'bar');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<OpenQA::Client> inherits from L<Mojo::UserAgent>. It
automatically sets the correct authentication headers if API key and
secret are available.

API key and secret can either be set manually in the constructor, via
attributes or read from a config file. L<OpenQA::Client>
tries to find a config file in $OPENQA_CONFIG,
~/.config/openqa/client.conf or /etc/openqa/client.conf and reads
whatever comes first.

See L<Mojo::UserAgent> for more.
